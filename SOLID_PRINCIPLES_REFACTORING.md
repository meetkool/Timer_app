# SOLID Principles Refactoring - Timer Widget

This document explains how the `timer_v2_widget.py` code has been refactored to follow SOLID principles.

## Overview

The original code was partially structured but had several violations of SOLID principles. The refactored version addresses these issues through proper separation of concerns, dependency injection, and interface segregation.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Before**: The `TimerView` class was handling multiple responsibilities:
- UI creation and layout
- Window dragging functionality  
- Close button management
- Custom window shaping
- Event handling
- Timer updates

**After**: Each class now has a single responsibility:

- **`Session`**: Manages session state and business logic
- **`Stopwatch`**: Handles time tracking functionality
- **`WindowShapeManager`**: Creates custom window shapes
- **`DraggableWindow`**: Manages window dragging behavior
- **`CloseButton`**: Handles close button functionality
- **`TimerDisplay`**: Manages timer display
- **`ProblemCounter`**: Manages problem counter display
- **`ActionButtons`**: Handles solve/unsolve/restore buttons
- **`TimerView`**: Coordinates UI components (composition over inheritance)

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Before**: Adding new features required modifying existing classes.

**After**: The code is now extensible without modification:

```python
# Easy to extend with new storage implementations
class DatabaseSessionStorage:
    def save_session(self, session: Session, stopwatch: Stopwatch) -> None:
        # Database implementation
        pass

# Easy to add new UI components
class ProgressBar:
    def __init__(self, parent: tk.Widget, bg_color: str = "black"):
        # New component implementation
        pass
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Before**: No clear inheritance hierarchy or interfaces.

**After**: Proper protocols ensure substitutability:

```python
# Any class implementing SessionStorageInterface can be substituted
def create_service_with_storage(storage: SessionStorageInterface):
    return SessionService(session, stopwatch, storage)

# Works with FileSessionStorage, DatabaseStorage, or any other implementation
service1 = create_service_with_storage(FileSessionStorage())
service2 = create_service_with_storage(DatabaseSessionStorage())
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Before**: No interfaces, leading to tight coupling.

**After**: Specific interfaces for different concerns:

- **`SessionStorageInterface`**: Only storage-related methods
- **`SessionServiceInterface`**: Only service-related methods  
- **`TimerEventHandler`**: Only event handling methods

```python
class TimerEventHandler(Protocol):
    """Interface for timer events - ISP"""
    def on_solve_problem(self) -> None: ...
    def on_unsolve_problem(self) -> None: ...

# UI components only depend on what they need
class ActionButtons:
    def __init__(self, parent: tk.Widget, event_handler: TimerEventHandler, ...):
        # Only depends on event handling, not entire view
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Before**: High-level modules depended on concrete implementations.

**After**: Dependencies are injected through abstractions:

```python
# High-level SessionService depends on abstraction
class SessionService:
    def __init__(self, session: Session, stopwatch: Stopwatch, 
                 storage: SessionStorageInterface):  # ← Abstraction
        # Implementation details
        
# Factory handles dependency creation and injection
class TimerApplicationFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_application() -> tuple[tk.Tk, TimerView]:
        # Create dependencies
        session = Session(total_problems=0)
        stopwatch = Stopwatch()
        storage = FileSessionStorage()  # ← Concrete implementation
        service = SessionService(session, stopwatch, storage)  # ← Injection
```

## Architecture Layers

The refactored code follows a clean architecture with clear layer separation:

### 1. Domain Layer
- **`Session`**: Core business entity
- **`Stopwatch`**: Value object for time tracking

### 2. Application Layer
- **Interfaces**: `SessionStorageInterface`, `SessionServiceInterface`, `TimerEventHandler`
- **Services**: `SessionService` (orchestrates business logic)

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **`FileSessionStorage`**: Concrete implementation of data persistence

### 4. UI Layer
- **Component Classes**: `WindowShapeManager`, `DraggableWindow`, `CloseButton`, etc.
- **View Coordinator**: `TimerView` (composes UI components)

### 5. Application Bootstrap
- **`TimerApplicationFactory`**: Handles dependency injection and application setup

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each class has a clear, single purpose
2. **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
5. **Flexibility**: Storage, UI components, and business logic can be swapped independently

## Example Extensions

Thanks to the SOLID design, you can easily:

```python
# Add new storage backend
class CloudSessionStorage:
    def save_session(self, session: Session, stopwatch: Stopwatch) -> None:
        # Upload to cloud
        pass

# Add new UI themes
class DarkThemeButtons(ActionButtons):
    def __init__(self, parent, event_handler):
        super().__init__(parent, event_handler, bg_color="#1a1a1a")

# Add new session types  
class PomodoroSession(Session):
    def __init__(self, work_minutes: int, break_minutes: int):
        super().__init__(total_problems=1)
        self.work_minutes = work_minutes
        self.break_minutes = break_minutes
```

The refactored code demonstrates how applying SOLID principles creates more maintainable, testable, and extensible software while maintaining the original functionality.

## New Feature: Session Restoration

Following the established SOLID principles, a session restoration feature was added that demonstrates the extensibility of the architecture:

### Implementation Details

1. **Storage Layer Enhancement**: 
   - Added `list_sessions()` and `load_session()` methods to `SessionStorageInterface`
   - Implemented concrete methods in `FileSessionStorage`

2. **Service Layer Extension**:
   - Added `get_available_sessions()` and `restore_session()` methods to `SessionServiceInterface`
   - Implemented session restoration logic in `SessionService`

3. **UI Layer Addition**:
   - Extended `TimerEventHandler` with `on_restore_session()` method
   - Added restore button to `ActionButtons` component
   - Implemented session selection dialog in `TimerView`

### Key Benefits of SOLID Design

The addition of this feature required **zero modifications** to existing code - only extensions:
- No existing classes were broken (Open/Closed Principle)
- Each component maintained its single responsibility (SRP)
- Dependencies remained abstracted (DIP) 
- Interfaces remained focused (ISP)

This demonstrates how proper SOLID design enables seamless feature addition without destabilizing existing functionality.
